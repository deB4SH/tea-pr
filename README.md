Gitea Action Pull Request
===

A small and simple github action that is designed for an image that contains the gitea cli and is run within a gitea ci system. 
The script simplifies the automatic creation of pull requests from a development branch towards a base branch. 

The action requires the gitea cli to be installed. When using it in your action workflow please install the cli from here [https://dl.gitea.com/tea/](https://dl.gitea.com/tea/) or use a prepared image like my ci-helm-image [https://github.com/deB4SH/ci-helm-image/blob/main/Dockerfile](https://github.com/deB4SH/ci-helm-image/blob/main/Dockerfile).
